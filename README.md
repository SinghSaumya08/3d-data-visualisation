Urban Spatial Analysis and Visualization
This project demonstrates urban spatial analysis and visualization techniques using Python. It includes scripts to load geospatial data, visualize land use patterns, property prices, population distribution, and more in Delhi, India.

Features
Data Loading: Load various types of geospatial data including GeoJSON files and CSV files.
Visualization: Visualize different aspects of urban data using libraries like PyDeck and Plotly.
Interactive Maps: Create interactive maps with layers for different types of land use, property prices, and population distribution.
Local Hosting: Host the visualization locally to share with others.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: pandas, geopandas, pydeck, plotly

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

Install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas geopandas pydeck plotly

Update the file paths in the Python scripts to load data from your GitHub repository. Replace "username", "repository", and "path/to/your/file" with your GitHub username, repository name, and the path to your files within the repository.
Run the Python script to visualize the data:

python visualization_script.py

Access the visualization by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000.
